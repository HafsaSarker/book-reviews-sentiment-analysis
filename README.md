### Description
In order to determine whether a given book review is a positive or a negative one:

1. Create a binary classifier that performs sentiment classification of book reviews
2. Convert book review text into numerical feature vectors using TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency)
3. Train a logistic regression model using those feature vectors
